DirectedGraph

DirectedGraph is a javascript object that represents a directed graph data structure with certaing useful functions on it. It can be used with GraphDracula Javascript Library to show them (http://www.graphdracula.net/)

To know more about it and use it correctly, read the commented code on the DirectedGraph.js file.

Soon i'll update this repository with examples implementing the GraphDracula graphic interface.

Thanks and enjoy.
